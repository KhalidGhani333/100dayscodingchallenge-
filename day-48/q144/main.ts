//Explain the use of the Promise.all() method with an example.

//*Explain & TIP:* Promise.all() takes an iterable of Promises and returns a single Promise that resolves 
//when all of the Promises in the iterable have resolved or when the iterable contains no Promises. 
//It is rejected if any of the passed Promises are rejected. This method is useful for aggregating the 
//results of multiple promises.

let promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
let promise2 = 13;
let promise3 = new Promise<string>((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, "do");
});

Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then((values) => {
  console.log(values);
});
